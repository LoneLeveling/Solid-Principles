So the problem here is that only Admin must have access to approve products
but still we are forced to implement the approve behaviour for all the classes
implementing User I<--interface
And also since only Admin can approve products so only on it calling the
"approveProduct" makes sense, so to handle that in the main class we have to
explicitly handle the Admin which also violates Liskov's substitution principle.

Now to fix this code see notes under Better Code section of Lesson5.

So for Problematic code to obey the LSP we created 2 interfaces:
1) UpiCompatibleCreditCard &
2) InternationalPaymentCompatibleCreditCard
And then whichever Credit card wants to support these services can implement the interfaces
accordingly and that class will have its own implementation of the UPI or international
payment API.

Like we made:
->VisaCard and MasterCard to support International payments.
->RuPayCard supports UPI payments.
